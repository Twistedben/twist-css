# Twist.css

A CSS library for making stylish buttons quickly, aligning content, and using phone/desktop/tablet responsiveness.
It can be used in conjunction with Bootstrap, but can completely replace Bootstrap, and in many ways improves upon the responsiveness of Bootstrap.

### Reason

I built Twist.css to replace using Bootstrap's mobile/desktop responsiveness in the Ossemble.com web app. I never liked the way Bootstrap had put restrictions and odd quirks in layout of columns and rows.
For example, using padding and margin inside columns in Bootstrap is very difficult and the distinction of mobile to desktop was hard to distinguish. 
Twist simply uses col-d for Desktop, col-t for Tablet, and col-p for Phone screen sizes. 

### WIP
------------
This is currently a work in progress. Will include documentation on how to use it and update it with more features, as well as compile to CSS from scss.
